# Fundamentals of Political Economy
## Markdown conversion

### Why
To make the book more accessible I wanted to host some chapters seperately online, mainly those I found particularly useful for understanding Marxist-Leninist-Maoist theory. However after realising it would be necessary for the footnotes I made a script that automated it, and then extended it to do most of the changes necessary (keyword: most, I can't be bothered to get better at sed to finish it), so now I figure I might as well just do the whole book.

For now I'm putting it up on GitHub in case anyone would like to contribute. The files in Text/unformatted/ have already been processed by the script so the rest would be done manually unless u write a better one lul. Images will come later.

### Where

After it's done I'll probably host it on my site or a GitHub page idk. The good thing about having converted the .xhtml pages from the original .epub is that all the legacy CSS stuff is gone and it can be re-fitted for any type of website.
